# üéôÔ∏è Meet Arty, your Voice-Powered Mobile Assistant

An open-source, privacy-first voice assistant for mobile with real-time API integration. Think "Ollama for mobile + realtime voice."

Connects to your Google Drive, Github, and the web. 

It's currently a thin wrapper around the OpenAI Realtime speech API, however the long term vision is to make it extensible and pluggable, with a fully open source stack.

## üéØ Why This Project Was Created

Voice AI is now incredibly powerful when connected to your data, yet current solutions are closed source, compromise your privacy, and are headed toward ads and lock-in.

This project offers a fully open alternative: local execution, no data monetization, and complete control over where your data goes.

<details>
  <summary>How to get the most out of it</summary>

- Connect your GitHub account: open the Hamburger Menu ‚Üí Configure Connectors ‚Üí GitHub and add a Personal Access Token. When creating the PAT, the recommended scopes are <code>gist</code>, <code>read:org</code>, and <code>repo</code>.
- Personalize Arty: adjust the system prompt, voice, VAD mode, and tool configuration from the Advanced settings sheets to match your workflow.
- Try out text chat mode when you can't use voice.  Under settings, configure it to use text chat mode.  Note, there's no streaming token support yet, so it feels pretty slow.

</details>

## ‚ú® Features

1. **Supports several connectors: Google Drive, Github, and Web Search** - Voice assistant that can summarize content in Google Drive, interact with Github, and search the web
3. **Extensible** - Adding connectors is fairly easy.  File an issue to request the connector you'd want to see.
4. **Customizable prompts** - Edit system and tool prompts directly from the UI
5. **Multi-mode audio** - Works with speaker, handset, or Bluetooth headphones
6. **Background noise handling** - Mute yourself in loud environments
7. **Session recording** - Optional conversation recording and sharing
8. **Voice and text modes** - Switch between input methods seamlessly
9. **Observability** - Optional Logfire integration for debugging (disabled by default)
10. **Privacy-first** - No server except connected services‚Äîyour data stays yours


## üöß Limitations

1. **Cost** - High OpenAI API costs due to poor context window management and fallback strategies
1. **Text Mode is limited** - The Text mode does not support streaming tokens yet.  It has a very basic and limited UX.
1. **Platform** - iOS only, no Android support yet due to currently using native WebRTC library, despite using React Native via Expo.  
1. **Performance** - Codegen is slow and unreliable. Most functionality should be moved to static tools
1. **UX** - No progress indicators during operations
1. **Security** - Dynamic codegen poses risks. Mitigation: use read-only access for connected services
1. **Recording** - Optional call recording implementation doesn't work very reliably since it regenerates the conversation based on a text transcript

## üîê Security + Privacy

> **Important note:** Although tokens never leave the device, some user prompts and connector content are transmitted to the OpenAI Realtime API by design. If you require strict local-only execution, do not use this app. Watch for future updates that support fully self-contained usage or privately hosted models instead.

**From a security perspective, the main risks are credential leakage or abuse**:

1. OpenAI API Key
1. Google Drive Auth Token
1. GitHub PAT

**Mitigation:** All credentials remain on-device, stored only in memory or secure storage (iOS Keychain). Audit the source code to verify that no credentials are transmitted externally.

<details>
  <summary>Security + privacy: storage, scopes, and network flow recap</summary>

- All token storage in memory and secure storage happens in `lib/secure-storage.ts`
- The actual saving/retrieval of tokens is delegated to the Expo library `expo-secure-store`
- Transport security: All outbound requests to OpenAI, Google, GitHub, and Logfire use HTTPS with TLS handled by each provider. This project does not introduce custom proxies or MITM layers.
- Prompt-injection and mis-issuance: The app does not currently detect or prevent malicious model output from executing unexpected write actions. Use read-only scopes wherever possible.
- OAuth tokens and API keys are stored via `expo-secure-store`, which maps to the iOS Keychain using the `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly` accessibility level. Tokens are never written to plaintext disk.
- Recording is off by default, and conversation transcripts are not saved. Optional recordings remain on-device and rely on standard iOS filesystem encryption.
- No third-party endpoints beyond OpenAI, Google, GitHub, and optional Logfire are contacted at runtime. The app does not embed analytics, crash reporting SDKs, or ad networks.

- The Google Drive OAuth scope used by the default Client ID in the TestFlight build is read-only‚Äîit can create or edit files that the app created, but cannot edit or delete files that originated elsewhere. For tighter control, register your own Google Drive app, supply its Client ID, and grant the permissions you deem appropriate.
- When creating a GitHub Personal Access Token, choose scopes based on your comfort level. Enable write scopes (for example, issue creation) explicitly‚Äîthey are not required for basic usage.
- Assume that connector operations which retrieve file contents may send that content to the LLM for summarization unless you have deliberately disabled that behavior.

Observability logs are disabled by default. Note that these should be automatically scrubbed of API tokens by Logfire itself. Only enable Logfire after you have audited the code and feel comfortable‚Äîthis is mainly a developer feature and not recommended for casual usage or testing.

Out of scope: This project does not currently defend against (1) on-device compromise, (2) malicious LLM responses executing actions against connected services using delegated tokens, or (3) interception of API traffic by the model provider.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building from source

<details>
  <summary>Installation steps</summary>

### Clone project and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vibemachine-labs/arty.git
cd arty
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
bun install
```

### Patch WebRTC headers

Before you run the app, patch the WebRTC library headers to work around [WebRTC issue #132](https://github.com/stasel/WebRTC/issues/132):

```bash
npm run wizard
```

And choose `1) Patch WebRTC-lib headers`, otherwise when building you will get `'sdk/objc/base/RTCMacros.h' file not found` errors.

> **Note:** Alternatively, pin the WebRTC pod version to 140, which does not have the headers issue.

### Create a Google Drive Client ID

When building from source, you will need to provide your own Google Drive Client ID.  You can decide the permissions you want to give it, as well as whether you want to go through the verification process.

[Google API Instructions](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/15549257)

For testing, the following oauth scopes are suggested:

1. See and download your google drive files (included by default)
1. See, edit, create, and delete only the specific Google Drive files you use with this app

### Run the app

To run in the iOS simulator:

```bash
bunx expo run:ios
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Audio is flaky on the iOS Simulator.  Using a real device is highly recommended.

To run on a physical device:

```bash
bunx expo run:ios --device
```

  <summary>Misc Dev Notes</summary>


### Disable onboarding wizard (optional)

For certain testing scenarios, disable the onboarding wizard by editing `app/index.tsx` and commenting out the `useEffect` block that evaluates onboarding status:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  let isActive = true;

  const evaluateOnboardingStatus = async () => {
    try {
      const storedKey = await getApiKey();
      const hasStoredKey = typeof storedKey === "string" && storedKey.trim().length > 0;
      if (!isActive) {
        return;
      }
      setOnboardingVisible(!hasStoredKey);
    } catch (error) {
      if (!isActive) {
        return;
      }
      log.warn("Unable to determine onboarding status from secure storage", error);
      setOnboardingVisible(true);
    }
  };

  if (!apiKeyConfigVisible) {
    void evaluateOnboardingStatus();
  }

  return () => {
    isActive = false;
  };
}, [apiKeyConfigVisible, onboardingCheckToken]);
```

### Development notes

- Project bootstrapped with `bunx create-expo-app@latest .`
- Refresh dependencies after pulling new changes: `bunx expo install`
- Install new dependencies: `bunx expo install <package-name>`
- Allow LAN access once: `bunx expo start --lan`

### Run on iOS device via ad hoc distribution

1. Register device: `eas device:create`
2. Scan the generated QR code on the device and install the provisioning profile via Settings.
3. Configure build: `bunx eas build:configure`
4. Build: `eas build --platform ios --profile dev_self_contained`

### Clean build

If pods misbehave, rebuild from scratch:

```bash
bunx expo prebuild --clean --platform ios
bunx expo run:ios
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

<details>
  <summary>Architecture overview</summary>

### Native Swift WebRTC Client

React Native WebRTC libraries did not support speakerphone mode reliably during prototyping. The native Swift implementation resolves that but adds complexity and postpones Android support.

### Codegen vs Static Tools

Dynamic code generation currently drives connector operations, enabling rapid prototyping. Longer term, the plan is to shift to statically defined tools with codegen as a fallback.

### MCP Support

Not implemented yet because all tools are local. Future versions will add MCP server support via cloud or local tunnel.

### Web Search

GPT-4 web search is a temporary bridge. The roadmap includes integrating a dedicated search API (e.g., Brave Search) using user-provided tokens.

### Voice / Text LLM backend

OpenAI is the only backend today. Adding multiple and self-hosted backends is on the roadmap.

</details>

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

1. Address limitations listed above
1. Improve text mode support
1. Investigate async voice processing to reduce cost
1. Add support for alternative voice providers ([Unmute.sh](https://unmute.sh/), [Speaches.ai](https://speaches.ai), self-hosted)
1. Remote MCP integration
1. TypeScript MCP plugin support

## üíº Business Model

**The app itself will remain completely open source, with no restrictions or limitations.**

**Business model TBD.** Likely a managed backend service using either:

* Azure OpenAI realtime APIs
* Fully open-source stack ‚Äî possibly [Unmute.sh](https://unmute.sh/) or [Speaches.ai](https://speaches.ai)
